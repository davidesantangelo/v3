Over the past few years, I've been getting more and more interested in what is going on in politics. I like to read the news while drinking my morning coffee. I built this site to aggregate all of the top news stories over the past day or so.

NewsFeeder is built on React. When the page is opened, it queries both the NewsAPI and /r/politics for the latest news and then displays it on the website.

Features

- Users can see top news articles
- Pagination is implemented for the News API stories.
