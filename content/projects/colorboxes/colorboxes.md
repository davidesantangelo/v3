I've always thought that Coolors.co was a pretty cool site, and have used it any time I needed to generate a color scheme. Inspired by that, and wanting to really dig into Redux, I built Colorboxes.

ColorBoxes lets you generate a random color scheme, choose to keep a color, or adjust the colors on the fly.

Features:

- React
- Redux
- Styled-Components
